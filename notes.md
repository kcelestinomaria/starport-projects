To add data types to our blockchain app,
we use ``starport type``

So, in Cosmos SDK, user make changes to 
the store by broadcasting messages.

Both CLI commands and HTTP requests create
messages that can be broadcasted in order for
state transition to occur

Messages are broadcasted, and then processed by an important part of the application, called
handlers
